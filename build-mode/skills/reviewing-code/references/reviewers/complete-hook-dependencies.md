# Complete hook dependencies

Always specify complete dependency arrays in React hooks to prevent bugs from stale closures and avoid unnecessary rerenders. When using hooks like `useEffect`, `useMemo`, or `useCallback`, include all values from the component scope that are referenced inside the hook's callback function.

For custom hooks that wrap React's built-in hooks:
1. Pass through dependency arrays correctly rather than hardcoding them
2. Avoid type assertions (like `as any`) that bypass dependency checking
3. Remember that global variables and constants defined outside the component don't need to be dependencies

```javascript
// ❌ Incorrect: Missing dependencies
function Component({foo, bar}) {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(foo, bar);
  }, []); // Missing foo and bar

  // ❌ Incorrect: Bypassing dependency checks
  useCustomCallback(callback, [] as any);
}

// ✅ Correct: All dependencies included
function Component({foo, bar}) {
  const nonreactive = 0; // Local constant
  
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(foo, bar, nonreactive);
  }, [foo, bar]); // nonreactive is a constant, doesn't need to be a dependency
  
  // ✅ Correct: Properly passing dependencies through
  useCustomCallback(callback, [callback]);
}
```

ESLint's exhaustive-deps rule can help identify missing dependencies automatically, preventing subtle bugs caused by stale closures.
