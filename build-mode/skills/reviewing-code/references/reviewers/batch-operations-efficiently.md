# Batch operations efficiently

Collect and execute similar operations together rather than performing them individually to reduce overhead and improve performance. This applies to entity creation, API calls, and state updates.

Key optimization strategies:
1. **Batch entity additions**: Collect all entities during initialization and add them with a single `async_add_entities()` call instead of multiple calls
2. **Combine executor jobs**: Group related synchronous operations into a single executor job to minimize expensive context switching between the event loop and thread pool
3. **Use selective updates**: Choose appropriate update mechanisms - use `async_update_listeners()` when state is already updated locally, or `async_request_refresh()` for buffered updates instead of immediate full refreshes

Example of batching entity creation:
```python
# Instead of multiple calls:
if param_sensors:
    async_add_entities(param_sensors)
if status_sensors:
    async_add_entities(status_sensors)
if alarm_sensors:
    async_add_entities(alarm_sensors)

# Collect all entities and add at once:
all_entities = []
all_entities.extend(param_sensors)
all_entities.extend(status_sensors) 
all_entities.extend(alarm_sensors)
if all_entities:
    async_add_entities(all_entities)
```

This approach reduces function call overhead, improves code clarity, and can significantly improve performance when dealing with large numbers of operations.
