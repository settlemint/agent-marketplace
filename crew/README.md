## Installation

Add the marketplace to your Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "agent-marketplace": {
      "source": {
        "source": "local",
        "path": "~/Development/agent-marketplace"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "crew@agent-marketplace": true
  }
}
```

Or use a local plugin directory:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ~/Development/agent-marketplace/crew
```

### Prerequisites

**Phantom CLI** (for worktree commands):

```bash
brew install phantom
```

Phantom is auto-detected on session start. If not installed, worktree commands will suggest installation.

## Standard Workflows

### Feature Development

The standard flow for implementing new features or addressing issues:

```
/crew:design      # Research and create implementation plan
/crew:build       # Execute the plan with progress tracking
/crew:check       # Multi-agent code review (7-leg)
/crew:git:pr      # Create pull request
/crew:git:fix-reviews  # Address reviewer feedback
```

### Daily Git Sync

Keep your branch up-to-date with main and sync PR state:

```
/crew:git:sync    # Rebase on main/parent + push + update PR
```

For stacked branches (git-machete):

```
/crew:git:traverse   # Sync entire stack with parents and remotes
/crew:git:slide-out  # Remove merged branches and update child PRs
```

### Quick Commits

```
/crew:git:commit         # Create conventional commit
/crew:git:commit-and-push  # Commit + push + update PR
/crew:git:push           # Push + update PR
```

### Stacked PRs

```
/crew:git:branch         # Create feature branch from main
/crew:git:stack-add      # Add branch to machete stack
/crew:git:pr             # Create PR with stack annotations
/crew:git:retarget-pr    # Change PR base to match machete parent
/crew:git:restack-pr     # Retarget + force push after rebase
/crew:git:go down        # Navigate to child branch in stack
```

### Worktrees + Stacked PRs

**Recommended pattern: One worktree per stack**

```
main-checkout/          # Stack A: feat/auth → feat/auth-ui → feat/auth-tests
worktree-payments/      # Stack B: feat/payments (independent feature)
worktree-hotfix/        # Stack C: fix/critical (independent bugfix)
```

**Creating worktrees (auto-switches to new worktree):**

```
/crew:git:worktree       # Create and switch to new worktree
/crew:git:worktree-switch  # Switch between existing worktrees
```

Branch names are auto-generated with username prefix: `username/type/description`

**Why this works:**

- Stacked PRs are sequential (depend on each other) → work naturally with machete
- Worktrees isolate independent work → no context switching between unrelated features
- Each worktree can use full machete commands (`traverse`, `go`) within its stack
- Auto-switch means no manual `phantom shell` or `cd` needed

**Navigation within a stack:**

```
/crew:git:go up          # Go to parent branch
/crew:git:go down        # Go to child branch
/crew:git:go next        # Go to sibling branch
```

The machete context automatically suggests next steps:

- ✅ **PR approved** → suggests moving to child branch
- ⏳ **PR open** → can continue on child while awaiting review
- 🔀 **PR merged** → suggests slide-out then move to child

**Safety detection:**

- Single stack in worktree → all machete commands work normally
- Multi-stack layout shared → warns about cross-stack navigation

**Worktree management:**

```
/crew:git:worktree-list    # See all worktrees
/crew:git:worktree-delete  # Clean up completed worktrees
/crew:git:worktree-checkout-pr  # Review PR in isolated worktree
```

### Code Review

```
/crew:check              # Full 7-leg review (correctness, security, etc.)
/crew:git:fix-reviews    # Resolve PR comments and CI failures
```
