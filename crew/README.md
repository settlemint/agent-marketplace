# Crew Plugin

Unified orchestration for work execution, skill creation, git conventions, and system management.

## Commands

### Core Workflow

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/crew:design` | Create validated implementation plan from feature/issue |
| `/crew:build` | Execute plan with TodoWrite progress tracking |
| `/crew:check` | Multi-agent 7-leg code review with triage |
| `/crew:fix` | Repair skills, resolve blockers |

### Git Operations

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/crew:git:sync` | Rebase on main/parent + push + update PR |
| `/crew:git:commit` | Create conventional commit |
| `/crew:git:commit-and-push` | Commit + push + update PR |
| `/crew:git:push` | Push to origin + update PR |
| `/crew:git:pr` | Create pull request |
| `/crew:git:fix-reviews` | Resolve PR comments and CI failures |

### Stacked PRs (git-machete)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/crew:git:branch` | Create feature branch from main |
| `/crew:git:stack-add` | Add branch to machete stack |
| `/crew:git:stack-status` | Show branch stack with visual indicators |
| `/crew:git:traverse` | Sync entire stack with parents/remotes |
| `/crew:git:slide-out` | Remove merged branches, update child PRs |
| `/crew:git:retarget-pr` | Change PR base to match machete parent |
| `/crew:git:restack-pr` | Retarget + force push after rebase |
| `/crew:git:advance` | Fast-forward merge child into current |

## Installation

Add the marketplace to your Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "agent-marketplace": {
      "source": {
        "source": "local",
        "path": "~/Development/agent-marketplace"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "crew@agent-marketplace": true
  }
}
```

Or use a local plugin directory:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ~/Development/agent-marketplace/crew
```

## Standard Workflows

### Feature Development

The standard flow for implementing new features or addressing issues:

```
/crew:design      # Research and create implementation plan
/crew:build       # Execute the plan with progress tracking
/crew:check       # Multi-agent code review (7-leg)
/crew:git:pr      # Create pull request
/crew:git:fix-reviews  # Address reviewer feedback
```

### Daily Git Sync

Keep your branch up-to-date with main and sync PR state:

```
/crew:git:sync    # Rebase on main/parent + push + update PR
```

For stacked branches (git-machete):

```
/crew:git:traverse   # Sync entire stack with parents and remotes
/crew:git:slide-out  # Remove merged branches and update child PRs
```

### Quick Commits

```
/crew:git:commit         # Create conventional commit
/crew:git:commit-and-push  # Commit + push + update PR
/crew:git:push           # Push + update PR
```

### Stacked PRs

```
/crew:git:branch         # Create feature branch from main
/crew:git:stack-add      # Add branch to machete stack
/crew:git:pr             # Create PR with stack annotations
/crew:git:retarget-pr    # Change PR base to match machete parent
/crew:git:restack-pr     # Retarget + force push after rebase
```

### Code Review

```
/crew:check              # Full 7-leg review (correctness, security, etc.)
/crew:git:fix-reviews    # Resolve PR comments and CI failures
```

## Features

### Work Orchestration
- Plan-driven development with `/crew:design`
- Progress tracking with TodoWrite integration
- Handoffs for context preservation across sessions
- Iteration loops for autonomous completion

### Skill Management
- Create new skills with guided workflows
- Audit and improve existing skills
- Templates for common skill patterns

### Git Conventions
- Conventional commit format enforcement
- Branch naming standards
- PR workflow automation

### Hooks
- Session state recovery on startup/resume
- Auto-lint on file modifications
- Git commit validation (requires CI pass)
- PR creation validation
