# maintain naming consistency

Ensure consistent naming conventions across the entire codebase, including terminology, file names, directory structures, and API naming. Inconsistent naming creates confusion and poor developer experience.

Key areas to maintain consistency:

**Terminology**: Use the same terms consistently across code, documentation, and templates. For example, choose either "browser" or "client" and use it consistently throughout the codebase rather than mixing terms.

**Directory/File Naming**: Maintain consistent naming patterns across templates, examples, and documentation. If using `app/routes/` in templates, use the same structure in tutorials and examples rather than switching to `app/pages/`.

**API Documentation**: Follow consistent naming patterns for documentation files, especially for unstable APIs. For example, consistently handle unstable API documentation naming to maintain stable URLs.

**File Naming**: Use descriptive, specific names rather than generic ones. Instead of `file-storage.server.ts`, use `avatar-storage.server.ts` to clearly indicate the file's purpose.

Example of inconsistent naming to avoid:
```tsx
// Documentation uses "browser" 
entry.browser.tsx

// But code comments refer to "client"
// This is the client entry point...

// Templates use different directory names
app/routes/contact.tsx  // in one template
app/pages/contact.tsx   // in another template
```

Before introducing new naming conventions, audit existing patterns and align with established conventions. When changes are necessary, update all related files, documentation, and examples simultaneously to maintain consistency.
