# Optimize React Component Dependencies

When implementing React components, ensure that dependencies between component state, props, and side effects are accurately tracked to prevent missed updates and unnecessary re-renders. This is crucial for maintaining efficient and responsive React applications.

Key practices:
1. Carefully analyze component state and derived values to identify all true dependencies for useEffect and other hooks.
2. Properly handle conditional rendering and dynamic dependencies in your use of hooks like useEffect.
3. Consider object identity and reference semantics when determining dependencies, especially for props and state.
4. Separate control flow dependencies from data dependencies when possible, using techniques like memoization.

Example:
```typescript
// Problematic - missing dependency in useEffect
function ProcessData({ inputData }: { inputData: any }) {
  const derived = condition ? sourceA : sourceB;
  
  // Later operations use 'derived' but don't track its dependencies
  useEffect(() => {
    process(derived.value);
  }, []); // Missing dependency on 'derived'
}

// Improved - proper dependency tracking in useEffect
function ProcessData({ inputData }: { inputData: any }) {
  const derived = condition ? sourceA : sourceB;

  // Correctly tracks the dependency on 'derived'
  useEffect(() => {
    process(derived.value);
  }, [derived]); // Properly includes derived as dependency
}
```

By carefully managing component dependencies, you can create more maintainable React code and improve the efficiency of your application, avoiding both unnecessary re-renders and missed updates.
