# Core Craft Principles

These apply regardless of design direction. This is the quality floor.

## The 4px Grid

All spacing uses a 4px base grid:

- `4px` - micro spacing (icon gaps)
- `8px` - tight spacing (within components)
- `12px` - standard spacing (between related elements)
- `16px` - comfortable spacing (section padding)
- `24px` - generous spacing (between sections)
- `32px` - major separation

## Symmetrical Padding

**TLBR must match.** If top padding is 16px, left/bottom/right must also be 16px. Exception: when content naturally creates visual balance.

```css
/* Good */
padding: 16px;
padding: 12px 16px; /* Only when horizontal needs more room */

/* Bad */
padding: 24px 16px 12px 16px;
```

## Border Radius

Stick to the 4px grid. Sharper corners feel technical, rounder corners feel friendly. Pick a system and commit:

- Sharp: 4px, 6px, 8px
- Soft: 8px, 12px
- Minimal: 2px, 4px, 6px

Don't mix systems. Consistency creates coherence.

## Depth Strategy

**Match your depth approach to your design direction.** Depth is a tool, not a requirement.

**Borders-only (flat)** — Clean, technical, dense. Works for utility-focused tools where information density matters more than visual lift. Linear, Raycast, and many developer tools use almost no shadows — just subtle borders to define regions. This isn't lazy; it's intentional restraint.

**Subtle single shadows** — Soft lift without complexity. A simple `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` can be enough. Works for approachable products that want gentle depth without the weight of layered shadows.

**Layered shadows** — Rich, premium, dimensional. Multiple shadow layers create realistic depth for products that want to feel substantial. Stripe and Mercury use this approach. Best for cards that need to feel like physical objects.

**Surface color shifts** — Background tints establish hierarchy without any shadows. A card at `#fff` on a `#f8fafc` background already feels elevated. Shadows can reinforce this, but color does the heavy lifting.

Choose ONE approach and commit. Mixing flat borders on some cards with heavy shadows on others creates visual inconsistency.

```css
/* Borders-only approach */
--border: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
--border-subtle: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
border: 0.5px solid var(--border);

/* Single shadow approach */
--shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);

/* Layered shadow approach (when appropriate) */
--shadow-layered:
  0 0 0 0.5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05), 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04),
  0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.03), 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02);
```

**The craft is in the choice, not the complexity.** A flat interface with perfect spacing and typography is more polished than a shadow-heavy interface with sloppy details.

## Card Layouts

Monotonous card layouts are lazy design. A metric card doesn't have to look like a plan card doesn't have to look like a settings card. One might have a sparkline, another an avatar stack, another a progress ring, another a two-column split.

Design each card's internal structure for its specific content — but keep the surface treatment consistent: same border weight, shadow depth, corner radius, padding scale, typography. Cohesion comes from the container chrome, not from forcing every card into the same layout template.

## Isolated Controls

UI controls deserve container treatment. Date pickers, filters, dropdowns — these should feel like crafted objects sitting on the page, not plain text with click handlers.

**Never use native form elements for styled UI.** Native `<select>`, `<input type="date">`, and similar elements render OS-native dropdowns and pickers that cannot be styled. Build custom components instead:

- Custom select: trigger button + positioned dropdown menu
- Custom date picker: input + calendar popover
- Custom checkbox/radio: styled div with state management

**Custom select triggers must use `display: inline-flex` with `white-space: nowrap`** to keep text and chevron icons on the same row. Without this, flex children can wrap to new lines.

## Typography Hierarchy

- Headlines: 600 weight, tight letter-spacing (-0.02em)
- Body: 400-500 weight, standard tracking
- Labels: 500 weight, slight positive tracking for uppercase
- Scale: 11px, 12px, 13px, 14px (base), 16px, 18px, 24px, 32px

## Monospace for Data

Numbers, IDs, codes, timestamps belong in monospace. Use `tabular-nums` for columnar alignment. Mono signals "this is data."

## Iconography

Use **Phosphor Icons** (`@phosphor-icons/react`). Icons clarify, not decorate — if removing an icon loses no meaning, remove it.

Give standalone icons presence with subtle background containers.

## Animation

- 150ms for micro-interactions, 200-250ms for larger transitions
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1)`
- No spring/bouncy effects in enterprise UI

## Contrast Hierarchy

Build a four-level system: foreground (primary) → secondary → muted → faint. Use all four consistently.

## Color for Meaning

Gray builds structure. Color only appears when it communicates: status, action, error, success. Decorative color is noise.

When building data-heavy interfaces, ask whether each use of color is earning its place. Score bars don't need to be color-coded by performance — a single muted color works. Grade badges don't need traffic-light colors — typography can do the hierarchy work. Look at how GitHub renders tables and lists: almost entirely monochrome, with color reserved for status indicators and actionable elements.

## Dark Mode

Dark interfaces have different needs:

**Borders over shadows** — Shadows are less visible on dark backgrounds. Lean more on borders for definition. A border at 10-15% white opacity might look nearly invisible but it's doing its job — resist the urge to make it more prominent.

**Adjust semantic colors** — Status colors (success, warning, error) often need to be slightly desaturated or adjusted for dark backgrounds to avoid feeling harsh.

**Same structure, different values** — The hierarchy system (foreground → secondary → muted → faint) still applies, just with inverted values.
