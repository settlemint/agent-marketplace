# Design Directions

Enterprise/SaaS UI has more range than you think. Consider these directions:

## Precision & Density

Tight spacing, monochrome, information-forward. For power users who live in the tool.

**Examples:** Linear, Raycast, terminal aesthetics

**Characteristics:**

- Minimal padding (8-12px)
- Monospace influence
- Borders over shadows
- Cool or neutral palette

## Warmth & Approachability

Generous spacing, soft shadows, friendly colors. For products that want to feel human.

**Examples:** Notion, Coda, collaborative tools

**Characteristics:**

- Generous padding (16-24px)
- Warm neutrals (cream, warm gray)
- Soft single shadows
- Humanist typography

## Sophistication & Trust

Cool tones, layered depth, financial gravitas. For products handling money or sensitive data.

**Examples:** Stripe, Mercury, enterprise B2B

**Characteristics:**

- Layered shadows
- Cool slate/blue-gray foundations
- Geometric sans typography
- Careful color restraint

## Boldness & Clarity

High contrast, dramatic negative space, confident typography. For products that want to feel modern and decisive.

**Examples:** Vercel, minimal dashboards

**Characteristics:**

- Pure black/white foundations
- Bold typography weights
- Large negative space
- Single accent color

## Utility & Function

Muted palette, functional density, clear hierarchy. For products where the work matters more than the chrome.

**Examples:** GitHub, developer tools

**Characteristics:**

- System fonts
- Dense information layout
- Subtle borders
- Functional color only

## Data & Analysis

Chart-optimized, technical but accessible, numbers as first-class citizens.

**Examples:** Analytics dashboards, BI tools

**Characteristics:**

- Monospace for data
- tabular-nums alignment
- Chart-friendly palettes
- Information density

**Pick one. Or blend two. But commit to a direction that fits the product.**
