Always use specific, accurate terminology rather than vague or generic terms when naming sections, referencing products, or writing documentation. Ensure grammatical correctness and technical precision in all naming contexts.

When referencing specific products or technologies, use their official names rather than broad categories. For example, use "JetBrains IDEs" instead of "IDEA based editors" when referring to IntelliJ, WebStorm, and similar tools. Similarly, maintain proper article usage and grammatical structure, such as "the Angular CLI" rather than "Angular CLI" when used as a subject.

This principle applies to:
- Section headers and documentation titles
- Product and technology references  
- Variable and method names in code
- Comments and technical writing

Example from documentation:
```markdown
// Vague and imprecise
### VS Code / Cursor Setup

// Precise and accurate  
### VS Code Setup
### Cursor / JetBrains IDEs Setup
```

Precise terminology reduces ambiguity, improves clarity, and demonstrates attention to detail in both code and documentation.
