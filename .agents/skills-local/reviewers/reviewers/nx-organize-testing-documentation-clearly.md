Ensure testing documentation is properly categorized and uses precise terminology to maintain clarity and accessibility. Testing concepts should be organized into appropriate sections (e.g., "Testing Tools" rather than generic categories) and described with accurate language that clearly conveys the intended meaning.

When documenting testing processes, choose precise terms that accurately describe the verification steps. For example, use "valid" instead of "correct" when referring to proposed fixes that meet acceptance criteria, as this better conveys the nature of the validation being performed.

Proper organization helps developers quickly locate relevant testing guidance, while precise terminology prevents misunderstandings about testing procedures and requirements. This approach ensures that testing documentation serves as an effective reference for development teams implementing various testing strategies.
